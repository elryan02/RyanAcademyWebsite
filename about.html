        <h4>our mission</h4>
           <p>The rich traditions of Ireland can be appreciated by people of all backgrounds. The goal of the Ryan Academy of Irish Dance is to pass on this beautiful culture to a new generation of artists through music and dance, and to encourage students to share their talents with others. <br><br>
            I believe that the showcasing of these skills, whether in community venues or on the competitive stage, instills invaluable traits such as confidence, poise, sportsmanship, focus and determination in the dancer. <br><br>
            Through Ceili (group) and Solo dance instruction, I will strive not only to preserve the centuries-old art form that is Irish dance, but also to enrich the community and foster the grace and integrity of every student. </p>

        <h4>community performances</h4>
            <p>We share our passion through free educational showcases. Contact us for your next event!</p>
